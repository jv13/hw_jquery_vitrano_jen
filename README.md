#jQuery Homework

##Links
* [Repo on GitHub](https://github.com/jv13/hw_jquery_vitrano_jen.git)

##Resources
* [Flexible Boxes:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes) The article content was used from this Mozilla link.
* I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

##Comments
* This was a fun quick assignment that helped to reinforce those long lectures that we watched on jQuery. As much as I love using css documents I think it's great that we are able to alter content visuals through jQuery.
